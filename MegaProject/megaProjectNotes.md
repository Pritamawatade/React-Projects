# Mega projects note :

First we have to install necessary libraries like appwrite, react-hook-form , html-react-parser , redux/js and all that with npm command.

After that we have to hid the backend variables with .env file. There are several ways to use the .env variable in to the application
like process.env if you have created app with create*react-app and VITE* if used vite.
